  "body": "# What is it ?\r\nA simple, free and open-source app for helping homeless people in facilitating the prevention and the assistance, without restrictions on locations, languages (interact with images) and with the respect of user and homeless privacy.\r\n\r\n# Why this application ?\r\nI used to know applications such as [homeless+](http://homelessplus.com) which is not working anymore. Without sources, it is impossible to launch this application on a new server. I want to develop an open-source application in order to make it [shareable, forkable](https://github.com/b3j0f/homeless/) and mainly not dependent from myself !\r\n\r\n# What do I need ?\r\n- Your [advices/ideas](https://github.com/b3j0f/homeless/issues) : I want to improve the society with you !\r\n- time and money : I choosed to stop to be an employee anymore in order to have time to develop such applications. Therefore, I opened this crowd funding page and I have a [liberapay](https://liberapay.com/b3j0f/donate) account. I don't need too much money, cause I am sure the open-source nature of this project will find contributors and maintainers. The thing which is not free is server prices. Therefore, I plan to be transparent with money I will get and I will be transparent with expenses in order to encourage crowd financiary participation.\r\n\r\n[![](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](https://liberapay.com/b3j0f/donate)\r\n\r\n@b3j0f\r\n",

Open the application, select a place around you where food is wanted and bring it there !**\r\n\r\n# Why this application ?\r\nInjury prevention and assistance are strongly helpful for homeless people and families in difficulty. I am sure several people would like to help them without a mean to know how, where and when to help.\r\n\r\nWith this kind of application, **you can know with who to share food, discuss, accomodate and much more, anytime and anywhere**. I am convinced there are more people ready to help than people in difficulty. Let's use the technology to help each other to improve the society !\r\n\r\n# Why open-source/data ?\r\nThe app [homeless+](http://homeless.com) is not working anymore. Without sources, it is impossible to launch this application on a new server. I want to develop an **open-source/data application in order to make it [shareable, forkable](https://github.com/b3j0f/simpleneed/), [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)able and mainly not dependent from myself !**\r\n\r\n# What do I need ?\r\n- Your [advices/ideas](https://github.com/b3j0f/simpleneed/issues): **I want to improve the society with you !**\r\n- Your development skills: want to provide some development skills ? Take a look to the [roadmap](https://github.com/b3j0f/simpleneed/projects/1).\r\n- Time and money: I choosed to stop to be an employee anymore in order to have time to develop such applications. Therefore, I opened this [crowd funding page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/b3j0f/1289896395?token=261a8b18) and I have a [liberapay account](https://liberapay.com/b3j0f/donate). **I need money only for development (about 105h * 25$ = 2625$), server renting (100$/month) and maintenance (500$/month)**. Because I think I need at least 10 months in order to convince people to donate for continuous server renting and support, I target about 2625$ + (100$ + 500$) * 10 = 8625$. **I round this objective to 10 000$** with little extras I can not predict right now and which might come quickly.\r\n\r\n**In order to encourage crowd funding and participation, I plan to be transparent with expenses during [project progress](https://b3j0f.github.io/simpleneed/) (which has started already) and its use !**\r\n\r\n# When will be this application available ?\r\nAs soon as possible because **winter is coming...**\r\n\r\n# What do I mean by privacy ?\r\nI don't trust in technology, therefore, **I don't want to track people** ! **Only location of needs of people in difficulty will be shared anonymously**, and location tracking will be optional on client side !\r\n\r\n# A last word...\r\nIn contributing to this project, you make an investment on future projects extended/forked/inspired from this one and those I want to develop for the society !\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\n- [Sources](https://github.com/b3j0f/simpleneed)\r\n- [travis](https://travis.com/b3j0f/simpleneed)\r\n- [documentation](https://readthedocs.com/b3j0f/simpleneed)\r\n- [issues/ideas tracking](https://github.com/b3j0f/simpleneed/issues)\r\n\r\n## Funding\r\n\r\n- [crowd funding page - kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/b3j0f/1289896395?token=261a8b18)\r\n- [![](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](https://liberapay.com/b3j0f/donate)\r\n- contributors...\r\n\r\n[b3j0f](https://github.com/b3j0f)\r\n",

Without sources, it is impossible to launch this application on a new server. I want to develop an open-source application in order to make it shareable, forkable and mainly not dependent from my self !\r\n\r\n# What do I need ?\r\n- Your energy and your advice\r\n- time and money : I choosed to stop to be an employee anymore in order to have time to develop such applications. Therefore, I opened this crowd funding page and I have a [liberapay](https://liberapay.com/b3j0f/donate) account.\r\n\r\n[![](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](![](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg))\r\n\r\n@b3j0f",

# What is it ?
A **simple, free, open-source ([MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)), [open-data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) ([REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)) web/mobile application** for **helping homeless and precarious people**. **Usable on the entire earth**, **universal** (no text and partially-sighted people option view mode) and with the **respect of user and people in difficulty privacy** (no need to be tracked, logged in and don't use personal information).

# Use case ?
**You have food to share ? Open the application, select a place around you where food is wanted and bring it there. Then notify the application if more needs are required.**

# Why this application ?
I ear often people tell me they want to help spontaneously people in difficulty, and I don't find an open-source application able to do that.

With this kind of application, **you can know with who to share food, discuss, accomodate and much more, anytime and anywhere**. I am convinced there are more people ready to help than people who need help. Let's use some technology to help each other !

# Why open-source/data ?
The app [homeless+](http://homeless.com) is not working anymore. Without sources, it is impossible to launch this application on a new server. I want to develop an **open-source/data application in order to make it [shareable, forkable](https://github.com/b3j0f/simpleneed/), [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)able and mainly not dependent from myself !**

# What do I need ?
- Your [advices/ideas](https://github.com/b3j0f/simpleneed/issues): **I want to improve the society with you !**
- Your development skills: want to provide some development skills ? Take a look to the [roadmap](https://github.com/b3j0f/simpleneed/projects/1).
- Time and money: I choosed to stop to be an employee anymore in order to have time to develop such applications. Therefore, I opened this [crowd funding page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/b3j0f/simple-need/) and I have a [liberapay account](https://liberapay.com/b3j0f/donate). **I need money only for development (about 105h * 25$ = 2625$), server renting (100$/month) and maintenance (500$/month)**. Because I think I need at least 10 months in order to convince people to donate for continuous server renting and support, I target about 2625$ + (100$ + 500$) * 10 = 8625$. **I round this objective to 10 000$** with little extras I can not predict right now and which might come quickly.

**In order to encourage crowd funding and participation, I plan to be transparent with expenses during [project progress](https://b3j0f.github.io/simpleneed/) (which has started already) and its use !**

# When will be this application available ?
As soon as possible because **winter is coming...**

# What do I mean by privacy ?
I don't trust in technology, therefore, **I don't want to track people** ! **Only location of needs of people in difficulty will be shared anonymously**, and location tracking will be optional on client side !

# A last word...
In contributing to this project, you make an investment on future projects extended/forked/inspired from this one and those I want to develop for the society !

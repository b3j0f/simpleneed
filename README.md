# What is it ?
A simple, free and open-source application about helping homeless people in facilitating the prevention and the assistance, without restrictions on locations, languages (interact with images) and with the respect of user and homeless privacy.

# Why this application ?
I used to know applications such as [homeless+](http://homelessplus.com) which is not working anymore. Without sources, it is impossible to launch this application on a new server. I want to develop an open-source application in order to make it [shareable, forkable](https://github.com/b3j0f/homeless/) and mainly not dependent from my self !

# What do I need ?
- Your [advices/ideas](https://github.com/b3j0f/homeless/issues)
- time and money : I choosed to stop to be an employee anymore in order to have time to develop such applications. Therefore, I opened this crowd funding page and I have a [liberapay](https://liberapay.com/b3j0f/donate) account.

# What is it ?
A simple, free and open-source/data web/mobile application for helping homeless people. Without restrictions on locations (usable on the entire earth), universal (no text, only images and view mode for partially-sighted persons) and with the respect of user and homeless privacy (no need to be tracked,  logged in and personnal information).

# Why this application ?
Injury prevention and assistance are strongly helpful for homeless people, and I am sure several people would like to help them without a mean to know how, where and when to help.

With this kind of application, you can know with who to share food, discussion, feelings and much more, anytime and anywhere. There are more people ready to help than homeless people in difficulty. Let's use the technology to help each other to improve the society !

# Why open-source/data ?
The app [homeless+](http://homeless.com) is not working anymore. Without sources, it is impossible to launch this application on a new server. I want to develop an open-source/data application in order to make it [shareable, forkable](https://github.com/b3j0f/simpleneed/), [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and mainly not dependent from myself !

# What do I need ?
- Your [advices/ideas](https://github.com/b3j0f/simpleneed/issues) : I want to improve the society with you !
- Time and money : I choosed to stop to be an employee anymore in order to have time to develop such applications. Therefore, I opened this [crowd funding page](https://kickstarter.com/projects/b3j0f/simpleneed) and I have a [liberapay account](https://liberapay.com/b3j0f/donate). I need money only for development (about 105h * 25$), server renting (100$/month) and maintenance (500$/month). Beceause I think I need at least 10 monthes in order to convince an organisation such as the "[International Committee of the Red Cross](https://www.icrc.org/fr)" to host this project on their dedicated servers, I target about 8625$. I round this objective to 10 000$ with little extras I can not predict right now and which might come quickly. In order to encourage crowd financiary participation, I plan to be transparent with expenses during [project progress](https://b3j0f.github.io/simpleneed/) which has started already, and its use !

# When will be this application available ?
As soon as possible because **winter is coming...**

# What do I mean by privacy ?
I don't trust in technology, therefore, I don't want to track people ! Only location of homeless needs will be shared anonymously, and location tracking will be optional and on client side !

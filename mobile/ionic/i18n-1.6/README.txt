i18n Ionic 1.6 README
==========================

Thank you for downloading i18n Ionic distribution.

This distribution includes a full working PhoneGap/Ionic project
source code. It's ready to run (almost) out the box.

Overview
--------

Specifically, your pack consists of the following four
directories:

    * [project]
      Includes a Grunt based ionic/cordova project. This is the project
      that is suggested to be used for development.
    * [release]
      Includes a generated Ionic project. This is a simplified version of
      the Grunt based project where all the grunt related automations and
      dependencies are stripped out.
    * [license]
      Includes the License information and references to
      third-party licenses.

You can use the ionic project to build a final mobile application or
to create your own ionic project for any platform, as long as this
is permitted by the License. You can dig into the source psd files and
modify them the way you want and reuse, as long as this is permitted by
the License.
